# Machine-Learning-Project


I decided to use the random forest model to build my machine learning algorithm as it is appropriate for a classification problem as we have and based on information provided in class lectures this model tends to be more accurate than some other classification models.

Below I fit my model on my training data and then use my model to predict classe on my subset of data used for cross validation.
